## Intent

Repository for personal changes as I am not trying to take over Master Merchant. If at such time @Philgo68 and @khaibit return to ESO then they are welcome to use my changes.

## ChangeLog for 3.5.06

- Updated Refresh routine. Reverted some aspects of it now that LibHistoire has been updated. It was taking too long again.

## ChangeLog for 3.5.05

- Added methods to prevent (significant) FPS drop when a new sale is added while the Master Merchant window is open. This is because I am starting to see new sales show again while online.
- Updated /mm dups
- Updated /mm clean to remove invalid item links
- Added additional routines to verify invalid item links

NOTE: The focus of invalid item links in the current versions will be explained in a sticky post. Please watch the comments section's sticky post for an update with an important announcement. There will also be an additional documentation update.

## ChangeLog for 3.5.04

- Adjusted Refresh routine so it will stop after events are sent even after an upcoming change to LibHistoire.

## ChangeLog for 3.5.03

- Added more verification for malformed item links.

NOTE: I forgot something in 3.5.02, so it's not available.

## ChangeLog for 3.5.01

- Updated refresh routine to announce when refresh is finished. The spinner in the Master merchant window will also stop spinning as well.

## ChangeLog for 3.5.00

- Fixed Gamepad errors when listing items.

NOTE: Thanks to Lyelu I have a gamepad that works with ESO. I can not promise anything but I am looking into how to add some of the simple basic features to the Gamepad UI. Although I hear that since the Gamepad usage is so low, according to ZOS that some mod authors use some Gamepad aspects of the game for convenience in keyboard mods. Meaning, it breaks the Gamepad portion of the game.

## ChangeLog for 3.4.9

- Added additional search index values
- Added routine for expanding Libhistoire when using the refresh button. (Still in testing)
- Added Popup Item Data to Master Merchant window for convenience

## ChangeLog for 3.4.8

- Fixed some minor typos
- Fixed search index values. The API has changed enough that the search terms were a bit broken. Items you are searching for should show up correctly now. Such as a green or purple heavy helm.
- Added initial lookup tables for upcoming changes to Saved Vars files
- Removed old auto next feature for the guild store. It was no longer used and it's just a bad idea especially when AGS is active because at least for AGS it will break it.

## ChangeLog for 3.4.7

- Update to ShoppingList extension to prevent duplicate items. Delete your ShoppingList.lua from your SavedVariables to reset it.

## ChangeLog for 3.4.6

- Added optional MM extension, ShoppingList

NOTE: Rothry has suggested this addition and at the time it did not seem like something I would add. Mainly because I am not sure I want to know everything I purchased. However, I am in the process of learning more about the MM Window, ZOS Scroll Lists, and other more complex parts of this beast of a mod. For that reason it is packaged with the mod and can be enabled or disabled. I hope you enjoy it.

EDIT: 12-9-2020; I will be overhauling both MM and the ShoppingList. The data for MM will be preserved and kept. The data from the ShoppingList will not be preserved because I will be obtaining different sales data from traders either from AGS or the vanilla UI if you do not have AGS installed or active.

## ChangeLog for 3.4.5

- Added the remaining help icons for the settings menu

NOTE: Still working on the documentation but as I have time to complete each section it will help explain the various options.

## ChangeLog for 3.4.4

- Restored color to the deal calculator when viewing items in the guild store

NOTE: Still looking into all the challenges for localizing the currency format and colorization. Thank you for your patience.

## ChangeLog for 3.4.3

- Opps forgot other language strings for new menu options

## ChangeLog for 3.4.2

- Updated settings menu including help icons that go directly to the documentation.
- Updated LibGuildRoster setup to attempt to control the columns better until the next update to the library.

## ChangeLog for 3.4.1

- Bugfix for not stopping LibHistoire properly during Refresh

## ChangeLog for 3.4.0

- Opps forgot other language strings for key-bind

## ChangeLog for 3.3.9

- Fix for setting days of history lower then 30
- Added key-bind to toggle History Graph


## ChangeLog for 3.3.8

- Added a 3rd Focus which can be used for CTRL + SHIFT for example
- Changed the name of the Master merchant window. See documentation. Link is on the description page.- - Made sure when displaying values in the inventory that the gold color is yellow
- Made sure the custom time range updates for the drop down menu

## ChangeLog for 3.3.7

- Opps forgot to add the new data pool to the manifest file

## ChangeLog for 3.3.6

- Bugfix for blacklist
- Fix typo in setting menu
- Added toggle for guild roster columns. Requires UI reload.
- Writs with the same item ID will be grouped together now.

NOTE: Prior to having Writs the last part of the item link was for potions only. This caused MM to treat writs of the same type but a different voucher count as different. I will be adding a new system for writs in a future version.

## ChangeLog for 3.3.5

- Updated gold price label to use in game API formatting.(Meaning less numbers with a decimal of '.00' This should also add some formatting for non English users. I will be testing this more.
- Added lookup table so that if you hover over an item twice, and no sales have been added, the tooltip needs to reconstruct less information. Should make tooltips take a little less time to draw for items have have close to 5000 sales in the MM database. There isn't much I can do to improve this more. Remember too much of a good thing... you can easily see trends with less data points over the same amount of time.

## ChangeLog for 3.3.4

- Added option to select mean or median when calculation outliers.

For a range from 1 to 999 the data with the mean could give you and average of 89 and with the median 42. While other items like chromium grains, you may not see much of a difference. You could have way more data points. For example 44 compared to 3000. Therefore the chromium grains will have a much more focused range. Nobody wants to buy chromium grains for 125,000. The shear quantity of data points make chromium grains show a more meaningful trend then another item with less then 100 sales.

## ChangeLog for 3.3.3

- Added toggle to use the default range for tooltips, for inventory as well.

## ChangeLog for 3.3.2

- Significant performance improvements when adding events during Refresh.
- Added Simple Indexing - For those who do not search sales and want MM to have a smaller memory footprint.
- Reduced forced Master Merchant window lock to 10 minutes for Refresh. Again after the next LibHistoire I will be able to unlock the window automatically after LibHistoire finishes sending events to MM.

NOTE: On my Lynnfield i3 4GB Ram Potato I was able to reduce the Refresh time for a backup that was about 12 days old to under 10 minutes. Your situation may be different. Again, if you have low FPS viewing All sales then LibHistoire is still working. Close the Master Merchant window and wait longer. Hopefully Sirinsidiator will update LibHistoire soon.

## ChangeLog for 3.3.1

- Removed leftover MM 2.x code that prevented the Refresh routine from properly locking the Master Merchant window. The 20 minute lock may not be sufficient depending on how much data there is in the cache. See the sticky post.

## ChangeLog for 3.3.0

- More updates to prevent errors when calculating outliers while holding down CTRL or SHIFT

## ChangeLog for 3.2.9

- Updated mean and standard deviation calculation
- Added median value calculation for use when determining outliers
- Updated routine for determining outliers

## ChangeLog for 3.2.8

- Performance increase to checking for duplicate sales. No optimization for adding new sales unfortunately. - Added temporary `/mm freeze` and `/mm unfreeze` for Master Merchant window when processing 100,000+ sales or more
- Temporary workaround until next LibHistoire update. After clicking Refresh the Master Merchant window will be locked and will not update for 20 minutes while MM and LibHistoire communicate.

NOTE: After the next update LibHistoire will have an internal API function I can check to know when data is being transmitted to MM and lock and unlock the Master Merchant window automatically.

## ChangeLog for 3.2.7

- Added taxes to `/mm export` feature, see documentation
- Adjusted saved vars tracking var for outlier prices

## ChangeLog for 3.2.6

- Added version check for LibHistoire 1.0.2
- Removed Info/Debug messages
- Updated when MM starts LibHistoire and begins listening for information

## ChangeLog for 3.2.5

- I will rant at Siri later, debug messages are not logged by his mod by default. I have changed it to Info, so I can see the output.

## ChangeLog for 3.2.4

- Added debug messages for nil value Lua error

## ChangeLog for 3.2.3

- Attempt to address error in MasterMerchant.lua:3971: attempt to index a nil value

## ChangeLog for 3.2.2

- Opps didn't save version number properly in manifest file.

## ChangeLog for 3.2.1

- Attempt to address error in MasterMerchant.lua:3965: attempt to index a nil value
- Code added to restrict listening to guild sales. Which is an attempt to address possible performance hits.

NOTE: I don't feel MM 3.2.0 really has an effect on the game in a drastic way. If there is any pause or freeze in any way that is just because the library is sending data on first use. If you have thousands of sales, up to maybe 30,000 or more sales in a busy guild all being sent to MM at once, there will be a freeze. This should settle down after a few days if you keep the new library linked.

## ChangeLog for 3.2.0

- Now using LibHistoire for guild sales instead of scanning guild history directly.

## ChangeLog for 3.1.0

- To display information on the roster MM now uses LibGuildRoster

## ChangeLog for 3.0.9

- Fix for error generated guild finder rather then guild history

## ChangeLog for 3.0.8

- Added localization strings for new "Use Sales History Size Only" to the rest of the languages

## ChangeLog for 3.0.7

- Fix Price Calculator Bug
- Add toggle to ignore min and max count when trimming sales data

## ChangeLog for 3.0.6

- Same as 3.0.4
- More recipe updates from - Dolgubon
- Fix for Lua errors for new saved vars - Dolgubon

## ChangeLog for 3.0.5

- Reverted back to 3.0.3 until a fix for Lua errors can be implemented

## ChangeLog for 3.0.4

- Adjustment to item link trait discovery Aldanga
- Update to recipe calculations Dolgubon (Still some recipes may not show mat price)
- Added event index count to guild history tab and the amount of history loaded in hours, days. Using a built in Zenimax routine. It does not show 1d 3h, just 1 day or 2 days.

## ChangeLog for 3.0.3

- Updated event monitor so it will properly activate after zoning

## ChangeLog for 3.0.2

- Added decrement button since background scan is no longer present. It will deduct 50 from the event index, more like a rewind just a bit if you think you missed a sale.

## ChangeLog for 3.0.1

- Uncommented a few things in MM clean when checking for numbers that should not be strings

## ChangeLog for 3.0.0

- Initial changes to add an event monitor for guild history as it comes in. This is the same feature as introduced in 2.4.8.

## ChangeLog for 2.5.0

- Reverted MM to the sate of Philgo's last update 2.3.1
- Fix for MasterMerchant_Util.lua:466 to fix bug introduced in 2.3.1
- Reverted all scanning mechanics to 2.3.1
- Reverted indexing and filtering mechanics to 2.2.1
- By reverting indexing and filtering mechanics this fixes the issues with personal sales not appearing in the master merchant window
- Updated Kiosk flip times for Tuesday. Which includes the removal of tracking the 9 day week prior to the kiosk flip.

## ChangeLog for 2.4.9

- Updated /mm help
- Typecast certain variables for comparisons. Which hopefully will not allow anymore duplicate sales entries.
- Changed verbose level for Event Monitor (Now verbose 5) Default verbose is 4
- Hopefully fixed bug with MasterMerchant.lua line:2218

## ChangeLog for 2.4.8

- Simple indexing and scanning removed (introduced in 2.3.1)
- Background scan removed (See NOTE1)
- /mm missing removed (See NOTE2)
- Added guild history monitoring
- Improved duplicate checking when using /mm dups

NOTE1: During testing the requests from the server were denied 1440 times and granted 30 times over a course of 40 minutes for 3 different guilds.

NOTE2: Guild history is not sorted. Therefore you can not start at a certain place by tracking a specific time or event and scan from that point. The only viable option is to track the number of events and then avoid scanning the same events.

## ChangeLog for 2.4.7

- Left a debug message active sorry

## ChangeLog for 2.4.6

- Left a debug message active sorry

## ChangeLog for 2.4.5

- Revised Kiosk cut off time routines

## ChangeLog for 2.4.4

- Removed Philgo's Simple Indexing and Simple Scanning.

Note: At this time there are still performance issues. I will be addressing them as time permits. Removing Simple Indexing and Simple Scanning will introduce old performance issues. There isn't anything I can do about that at this time. I went with functionality over performance for now.

## ChangeLog for 2.4.3

- Fixed some typos

## ChangeLog for 2.4.2

- Revised Kiosk cut off time routines

NOTE: Needs testing for EU

## ChangeLog for 2.4.1

- Oops missed a few debug message thresholds

## ChangeLog for 2.4.0

- Time between scans 5 minutes minimum now because data is provided by the server without requesting it.
- Time between requests for data 30 seconds because the server already gives you data about once a minute.

NOTE: After more testing with my new cache library there is no reason to send frequent requests to the server for more data because the request is denied. Data is already provided about every minute. My cache library shows that with that kind of interval, 2 to 3 minutes you would be caught up as far as sales for your guild. After that you would just receive data you already have plus any new sales. This includes being logged out for 5 hours.

## ChangeLog for 2.3.9

- Removed some of the additional delays.

## ChangeLog for 2.3.8

- Removed left over debug routines for mouse over controls when verbose was set to 5

## ChangeLog for 2.3.2

- Fix for MasterMerchant_Util.lua:466
- More refactoring for how Libraries load

## ChangeLog for 2.3.1

- Switched Guild cut-over time.
- Added new recipes for Craft Cost calculations.
- Added 'Simple Guild History Scanning' setting which makes guild scanning much simpler, but may leave gaps in your historical data.
- Added 'Minimal Indexing' setting option to conserve memory at the expense of search flexibility and speed in the MM window.
- Reworked Libraries

## ChangeLog for 2.2.1

Turbo Mode removed at ZOS's request.

## ChangeLog for 2.2.0

Turbo Mode
-  '/mm turbo' will toggle Guild Scanning Turbo Mode on/off.
-  Please use Turbo mode sparingly, think of the poor servers!
-  Turbo mode is not available from 1 hour before trader flip until 1 hour after trader flip.
-  Turbo mode status is NOT remembered across reloads/logins and must be manually activated.
When you join a new guild, MM scans back only 3 days to get you started. You can manually load more with the '/mm missing' command.
Added new recipes to Craft Cost calculations.
Please visit tinyurl.com/MMIssueGuide if you are having any issues with MM.

Adjusted "verbose" setting, creating different levels of messages MM will provide:  0 - Nearly Silent to 5 - Debugging Level Messages.
Added scan status (in %) for each guild, if your "verbose" setting is 4 or higher.
Scanning for the first time after install or after doing a reset will now go back only 3 days. (You can use /mm missing to scan back further if you would like.)
(Note: /reloadui or switching characters retains the downloaded guild sales history, and MM will pick up from there.)
(Note: If you are getting FPS pauses when scanning, make sure the Guild History tab is not on the SALES Category.)

Adjusted  /mm clean  and  /mm dups  to catch and remove more types of bad data

## ChangeLog for 1.7.1d

Added an option to put the MM value of items on your inventory and deconstruction item lists.
Added a "/mm clean" option to scan for and remove malformed sales records.
Created an Execution Queue library for long running/sequential operations.

SPEED - Initialization is now 3 times faster and filtering the guild item summary list is at least 15 times faster.

Adjusted Guild Item to summarize better and show count of both transactions and items.  Ex.  4 sales totaling 400 items. (Per @eg0b0y's specs - IBoB auction)
Buyers are now checked against the blacklist (You can blacklist yourself to keep your great finds from pulling down the average.)
Added some new filters to the item list. (Trait, type, quality.  see /mm help)
Made Item list only display your default number of days worth of sales.  Loading 380k records was too slow...

## ChangeLog for 1.6.18
